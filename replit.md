# Overview

This is a React-based landing page application automatically generated by Anima, built with modern web technologies. The project features a single-page application (SPA) that showcases a product or service with an integrated registration modal system. The application uses a contemporary tech stack including React 18, TypeScript, Vite for development tooling, and Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI components for styling and user interface elements.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The application follows a component-based React architecture with TypeScript for type safety. The main entry point is `src/index.tsx` which renders a single `LandingPage` component. The project uses React 18 with StrictMode for development safety and modern React features.

## Component Structure
The application is organized into logical component directories:
- **UI Components**: Located in `src/components/ui/` following Shadcn UI patterns with reusable components like Button and Card
- **Feature Components**: Custom components like `RegistrationModal` for specific functionality
- **Screen Components**: Page-level components like `LandingPage` that compose the main user interface

## Styling Architecture
The project uses a utility-first CSS approach with Tailwind CSS as the primary styling framework. Custom CSS variables are defined for theming (colors, border radius, animations) and the design system supports both light and dark mode variations through CSS custom properties.

## Build System
Vite serves as the build tool and development server, providing fast hot module replacement and optimized production builds. The configuration includes React plugin support and PostCSS integration for Tailwind processing.

## State Management
The application uses React's built-in state management with hooks (useState) for local component state. No external state management library is implemented, keeping the architecture simple for a single-page application.

## Routing
React Router DOM is included as a dependency, suggesting support for client-side routing, though the current implementation shows a single-page structure.

# External Dependencies

## UI Framework Dependencies
- **React & React DOM**: Core framework (v18.2.0) for building the user interface
- **Shadcn UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with class-variance-authority for component variants
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography throughout the application

## Styling Dependencies
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Tailwind Merge & clsx**: Utilities for conditional and merged CSS class names
- **Tailwindcss Animate**: Animation utilities extending Tailwind's capabilities

## Development Dependencies
- **Vite**: Modern build tool and development server
- **TypeScript**: Type checking and enhanced developer experience
- **ESBuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler used by Vite

## Font Integration
- **Google Fonts**: Outfit font family imported via CDN for typography consistency

The application is designed to be self-contained with minimal external service dependencies, focusing on providing a smooth user experience through modern web technologies and responsive design patterns.
